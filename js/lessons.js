/* Ready-made lessons, as data.
   These used to be one lesson built by hand inside makeLesson(), which meant
   the only way to see it again was to clear the browser's storage so the app
   thought it was a first run. They are content, not code: a lesson here is a
   plain object, and adding another one is adding an entry to this array.
   A .js file rather than .json so the app still works opened from disk, where
   fetch() of a local file is blocked. */
